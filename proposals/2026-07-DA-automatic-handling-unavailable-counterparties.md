## Abstract
This proposal introduces an automated, persistent counterparty lifecycle management system in the SV App to handle unresponsive counterparties and those with vetting errors. 
By shifting counterparty exclusions from in-memory lists to persistent SQL-level anti-joins and isolating failures via recursive batch splitting, 
this mechanism prevents failing nodes from blocking healthy trigger processing, eliminates manual operator intervention, and scales up to 100M total network parties.

## Specification

### 1. Objective

Unresponsive counterparties and counterparties with vetting errors currently lead to unnecessary system load and failures. 
As a consequence, critical background automations have been disabled, such as transfer preapproval expirations, leaving stale contracts on the ledger, causing confusing errors for operators.
Furthermore, a single failing party stalls entire transaction batches, preventing certain automations from making progress on available tasks.
Existing manual exclusion workarounds are extremely fragile, as observed for example in featured app marker conversions, where parties were mistakenly ignored.
This design introduces an automation in the SV App that detects, excludes and reintegrates unavailable parties. 
This ensures network resilience and availability while eliminating hours of manual intervention in the network.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The feature automates the full ignore lifecycle of problematic network counterparties with minimal human intervention:
* **Automated Detection & Exclusion**: Instantly identifies counterparties that time out or run outdated node versions, temporarily bypassing them at the database level so healthy transactions process without delay.
* **Precision Failure Isolation**: Pinpoints failing parties within a batch rather than blocking the entire transaction batch.
* **Automatic Recovery**: Automatically re-attempts processing using exponential backoff. Once a counterparty recovers, they are restored to active status.
* **Operational Guardrails**: Includes a protected safety list to prevent critical ecosystem actors from accidental exclusion, paired with Prometheus metrics for real-time operational dashboard visibility.

### 3. Architectural Alignment

Aligns with the ecosystem priorities for resilience, operational cost reduction, and scalable performance. 
Decoupling core automation triggers from unavailable nodes ensures that a single participant's downtime or delayed upgrade never degrades performance for the rest of the network.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

Non-disruptive rollout with low risk to existing system integrations or user workflows:
* **Flag-Gated Deployment**: All new features are behind feature flags, allowing controlled rollout.
* **Preserved Manual Overrides**: Static ignore lists (e.g., `ignoredPartyIds`) remain fully supported, allowing operators to maintain manual overrides alongside the automation.
* **Zero-Downtime Schema Updates**: Database enhancements are strictly additive and require no breaking changes or maintenance windows.

## Motivation
SV triggers are background automations that keep shared validator workflows moving (for example, expiring outdated contracts and processing batched updates across
participants). When these triggers cannot make progress because unavailable counterparties block execution, healthy tasks are delayed, operator load increases,
and user-facing behavior becomes inconsistent and difficult to diagnose.

Recent incidents make this impact concrete:
- **Preapproval expiry automation was disabled** in some environments, which left contracts unexpired and produced confusing downstream errors for `sv-nodeops`.
- **Manual party-ignore handling proved fragile** during featured app marker conversion: parties were sometimes ignored when they should not have been, not unignored after recovery, or left blocking automation until manually added to ignore lists.

Automating detection, exclusion, and reintegration addresses these failure modes directly, improving reliability while reducing recurring manual intervention.

---

## Rationale
Instead of passing slow in-memory lists into database queries, this design uses persistent database anti-joins to cleanly filter out broken nodes at the source. 
When errors occur, recursive batch splitting isolates the exact failing party while exponential backoff automatically restores them once recovered. 
This approach directly extends existing SV triggers without replacing system infrastructure.
